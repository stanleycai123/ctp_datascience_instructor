In this class we will be going over the basics of linear regression in Python. 

1. Download the files by clicking green "Clone or Download" button, then "As ZIP."

2. Navigate to the cuny_tutorial.py folder. Open it in Spyder IDE and await further instructions.


Previous knowledge assumptions:

1 Basic working knowledge of Python, Spyder IDE (through Anaconda) pre-installed.
2 Prior exposure to single-variate linear regression

Class outline:

1 Introduction to multivariate linear regression
2 Introduction to overfitting and bias-variance; linear regression as (relatively) high bias low variance model.
2 Walk-through of basic features of Pandas
3 Sample exploratory data analysis (checking for outliers, distribution of dataset)
4 Running linear regression model via sklearn
5 Checking for overfitting using train-test split.
6 If overfitting, how to handle? If underfitting, how to handle?
